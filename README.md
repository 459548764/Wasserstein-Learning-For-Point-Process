## Paper Abstract:
Point processes are becoming very popular in modeling asynchronous sequential
data due to their sound mathematical foundation and strength in modeling a variety
of real-world phenomena. Currently, they are often characterized via intensity
function which limits modelâ€™s expressiveness due to unrealistic assumptions on
its parametric form used in practice. Furthermore, they are learned via maximum
likelihood approach which is prone to failure in multi-modal distributions of
sequences. In this paper, we propose an intensity-free approach for point processes
modeling that transforms nuisance processes to a target one. Furthermore, we train
the model using a likelihood-free leveraging Wasserstein distance between point
processes. Experiments on various synthetic and real-world data substantiate the
superiority of the proposed point process model over conventional ones.
